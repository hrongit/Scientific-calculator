# INTRODUCTION
Using the Python programming language and the
Tkinter GUI module, we are creating a scientific calculator that the user
can simply use. This calculator has functions like add, sub, div, mul, cos,
roots, and others. Tkinter helps to create an interface that can be
operated with buttons. We can solve any mathematical problem by using
the Arithmetic-Logic Unit (ALU), which has all the mathematical functions.
# OBJECTIVES
1.Scientific calculators can be applied generally to solve fractional, root,
and operation-related questions. When a situation calls for several stages
to be taken, this kind of calculator is helpful.<br>
2.A scientific calculator can be used to answer arithmetic issues involving
algebraic expressions, other sorts of functions, operations with
polynomials and fractions, square roots, and other forms of roots.<br>
3.Problems involving logarithms, trigonometric equations, and exponential
functions can be solved with these calculators.
